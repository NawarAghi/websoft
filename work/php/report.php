<h2>S01</h2>
<p><em>1- Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown
  and/or GitHub Pages?</em></p>
<p>I know about Git and GitHub because in the first year we did a project
   and we connected it to GitHub. In the second year,I worked with GitHub
    desktop application because I found it more easier than using Git bash.
    However, I have never worked with GitHub pages before.</p>
<p><em>2- Have you ever created websites before?</em></p>
<p>I have never created websites before. However, I have worked a little
  bit with HTML and CSS before. So, I am familiar with some basics of
  HTML and CSS.</p>
<p><em>3- Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web
  application development.</em></p>
  <p>I have worked with HTML and CSS but a little bit. However,
     I studied Network Applications course which I learnt to work
     with backend and create servers and clients using Java.</p>
     <p><em>4- What is your TIL for this course section?</em></p>
     <p>In the first assignment, I learnt to use GitHub pages and to fork.
       In addition, I became more familiar with Git bash and create tags
       using git bash.</p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p><em>1. Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?
</em></p>
<p>I have some experience of HTML and CSS. However, I don't have any
experience of JavaScript</p>
<p><em>2. Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in
   web development.</em></p>
<p>HTML is used to create basic and simple webpages, CSS is used to style
and decorate the HTML webpages and to make HTML webpage look better and
nicer, and JavaScript is used to make webpages dynamic. It gives the user
the ability to interact with webpages dynamiclly. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
 work together as a frontend.</p>
 <p><em>3. Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol
   and the web server interacts.</em></p>
   <p>The browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real
     address of the server that the website lives on. The browser sends an HTTP
     request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to
     the client. This message, and all other data sent between the client
      and the server, is sent across internet using TCP/IP.</p>

<h2>S03</h2>
<p><em>1. Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</em></p>
<p>No. I don't have any experience in JavaScript. This is my first time I see
   JavaScript code and deal with it. However, it looks an intresting and
   a powerful programming language</p>
<p><em>2. Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other
  language you know?</em></p>
<p>JavaScript looks like Java and C++, which it has functions, variable,
  loops, and conditions. It's not hard to learn it and use it</p>
<p><em>3. Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade
  do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</em></p>
<p> In gerneral, I followed the teacher's instructions and examples in order
  to write the code and understand it. In addition, I watched some tutorials
  on Youtube, Udemy, and W3Schools in order to increase my knowledge and
  to learn faster. I'm aming to get 5 because I did all the instructions of
  grade 5 that the teacher posted it on Canvas. Higher grade means harder
  requirements which it requires more effort to get the highest grade.
  The highest grade means more knowledge and that is why I'm aiming to 5. </p>
<p><em>4. What is your TIL for this course section?</em></p>
<p>I learnt in this section of the course many useful and intresting things
   such as creating functions, loops, variables in JavaScript; adding
   JavaScript file to HTML webpages, calling JavaScript functions from
  HTML webpages by using onclick method, creating classes and ids in HTML
  webpages and using them in CSS file, adding style to elements and changing
  them from JavaScript, and styling HTML webpages using CSS and making it
  more dynamically using JavaScript.</p>

<h2>S04</h2>
<p><em>1. Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal
   programming tools.</em></p>
<p>I have no experience on Node/npm. I attended lecture 4 which was
   about JavaScript, NodeJs and Express. I listened to the teacher and I
   learnt the basic of NodeJs and Express and its usages</p>
<p><em>2. How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node
  and Express?</em></p>
<p>It's really interesting to learn JavaScript, NodeJs and Express to combine
them together in order to make webpages dynamiclly and more organized</p>
<p><em>3. Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have
  a plan and did it work?</em></p>
<p>First, I learnt the code from the teacher during the lecture and the lab.
  Then, I watched some tutorials on Youtube in order to expand my knowledge
  and improve myself. My plan was to follow the teacher instructions and his
  code, then, to apply my knowledge that I got it from tutorials. My plan
  worked perfectly because of the knowledge that I grasped from the teacher
  and tutorials</p>
  <p><em>4. What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</em></p>
  <p>I'm aiming to grade<em>5</em>. Because, I did all the required
    assignments and I organized my code. However, it was a little bit
    hard to do all the assignments becuase all assignments require a
    good knowledge in NodeJs, JavaScript and Express.</p>
  <p><em>What is your TIL for this course section?</em></p>
  <p>I learnt about NodeJs, Express and JavaScript and how to combine them
    together. I learnt how to create local servers using Express, creating
    middlewares and its usages and advantages, create routing and its
    usages. In addition, I learnt how to create ejs webpages that have HTML
    code and javascript code, to work with requests and responses using
    Express, and to send Json files using Express.</p>

<h2>S06</h2>
<p><em>1. How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</em></p>
<p>It's a pwerful, widely-used, open source, general-purpose and scripting
  language that is used for web development and to make HTML webpages more
  dynamiclly. I like PHP because I can combine it with HTML and I can
  meake the webpages more organized and stylish</p>
  <p><em>2. Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</em></p>
  <p>PHP is implemented by C and C++. It looks like JavaScript as well.
     Because both of them are used for web development specifically for backend.
     Python also comes close to PHP on usage - and in fact, Python can be used
     as a substitute for PHP in many cases.</p>
  <p><em>3. Describe how you took on the coding exercise,
     what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</em></p>
  <p>Firstly, I learned from the teacher about PHP during the lecture. Then,
     I attended the lab where I saw the teacher writing a PHP code and
     listened to his comments. Secondly, I watched tutorials on Youtube to
     increase my knowledge and enhance my performance. I am aiming to get
     <em>5</em>. Because I did all the requirements of grade 5 and I
     followed the teacher instructions written on canvas.</p>
  <p><em>4. What is your TIL for this course section?</em></p>
  <p>I learned to create PHP files, combine PHP and HTML in one file, connect
     to database through PHP, run Apache server and apply CRUD on database
     inside PHP files. In addition, I learnt about forms in HTML and how to
     use them properly</p>
