<h1>A report from the course XXX</h1>
</header>

<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
<p><em>1- Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown
  and/or GitHub Pages?</em></p>
<p>I know about Git and GitHub because in the first year we did a project
   and we connected it to GitHub. In the second year,I worked with GitHub
    desktop application because I found it more easier than using Git bash.
    However, I have never worked with GitHub pages before.</p>
<p><em>2- Have you ever created websites before?</em></p>
<p>I have never created websites before. However, I have worked a little
  bit with HTML and CSS before. So, I am familiar with some basics of
  HTML and CSS.</p>
<p><em>3- Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web
  application development.</em></p>
  <p>I have worked with HTML and CSS but a little bit. However,
     I studied Network Applications course which I learnt to work
     with backend and create servers and clients using Java.</p>
     <p><em>4- What is your TIL for this course section?</em></p>
     <p>In the first assignment, I learnt to use GitHub pages and to fork.
       In addition, I became more familiar with Git bash and create tags
       using git bash.</p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p><em>1. Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?
</em></p>
<p>I have some experience of HTML and CSS. However, I don't have any
experience of JavaScript</p>
<p><em>2. Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in
   web development.</em></p>
<p>HTML is used to create basic and simple webpages, CSS is used to style
and decorate the HTML webpages and to make HTML webpage look better and
nicer, and JavaScript is used to make webpages dynamic. It gives the user
the ability to interact with webpages dynamiclly. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
 work together as a frontend.</p>
 <p><em>3. Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol
   and the web server interacts.</em></p>
   <p>The browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real
     address of the server that the website lives on. The browser sends an HTTP
     request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to
     the client. This message, and all other data sent between the client
      and the server, is sent across internet using TCP/IP.</p>

<h2>S03</h2>
<p><em>1. Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</em></p>
<p>No. I don't have any experience in JavaScript. This is my first time I see
   JavaScript code and deal with it. However, it looks an intresting and
   a powerful programming language</p>
<p><em>2. Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other
  language you know?</em></p>
<p>JavaScript looks like Java and C++, which it has functions, variable,
  loops, and conditions. It's not hard to learn it and use it</p>
<p><em>3. Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade
  do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</em></p>
<p> In gerneral, I followed the teacher's instructions and examples in order
  to write the code and understand it. In addition, I watched some tutorials
  on Youtube, Udemy, and W3Schools in order to increase my knowledge and
  to learn faster. I'm aming to get 5 because I did all the instructions of
  grade 5 that the teacher posted it on Canvas. Higher grade means harder
  requirements which it requires more effort to get the highest grade.
  The highest grade means more knowledge and that is why I'm aiming to 5. </p>
<p><em>4. What is your TIL for this course section?</em></p>
<p>I learnt in this section of the course many useful and intresting things
   such as creating functions, loops, variables in JavaScript; adding
   JavaScript file to HTML webpages, calling JavaScript functions from
  HTML webpages by using onclick method, creating classes and ids in HTML
  webpages and using them in CSS file, adding style to elements and changing
  them from JavaScript, and styling HTML webpages using CSS and making it
  more dynamically using JavaScript.</p>
