<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
<p><em>1- Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown
  and/or GitHub Pages?</em></p>
<p>I know about Git and GitHub because in the first year we did a project
   and we connected it to GitHub. In the second year,I worked with GitHub
    desktop application because I found it more easier than using Git bash.
    However, I have never worked with GitHub pages before.</p>
<p><em>2- Have you ever created websites before?</em></p>
<p>I have never created websites before. However, I have worked a little
  bit with HTML and CSS before. So, I am familiar with some basics of
  HTML and CSS.</p>
<p><em>3- Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web
  application development.</em></p>
  <p>I have worked with HTML and CSS but a little bit. However,
     I studied Network Applications course which I learnt to work
     with backend and create servers and clients using Java.</p>
     <p><em>4- What is your TIL for this course section?</em></p>
     <p>In the first assignment, I learnt to use GitHub pages and to fork.
       In addition, I became more familiar with Git bash and create tags
       using git bash.</p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p><em>1. Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?
</em></p>
<p>I have some experience of HTML and CSS. However, I don't have any
experience of JavaScript</p>
<p><em>2. Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in
   web development.</em></p>
<p>HTML is used to create basic and simple webpages, CSS is used to style
and decorate the HTML webpages and to make HTML webpage look better and
nicer, and JavaScript is used to make webpages dynamic. It gives the user
the ability to interact with webpages dynamiclly. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
 work together as a frontend.</p>
 <p><em>3. Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol
   and the web server interacts.</em></p>
   <p>The browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real
     address of the server that the website lives on. The browser sends an HTTP
     request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to
     the client. This message, and all other data sent between the client
      and the server, is sent across internet using TCP/IP.</p>

<h2>S03</h2>
<p><em>1. Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</em></p>
<p>No. I don't have any experience in JavaScript. This is my first time I see
   JavaScript code and deal with it. However, it looks an intresting and
   a powerful programming language</p>
<p><em>2. Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other
  language you know?</em></p>
<p>JavaScript looks like Java and C++, which it has functions, variable,
  loops, and conditions. It's not hard to learn it and use it</p>
<p><em>3. Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade
  do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</em></p>
<p> In gerneral, I followed the teacher's instructions and examples in order
  to write the code and understand it. In addition, I watched some tutorials
  on Youtube, Udemy, and W3Schools in order to increase my knowledge and
  to learn faster. I'm aming to get 5 because I did all the instructions of
  grade 5 that the teacher posted it on Canvas. Higher grade means harder
  requirements which it requires more effort to get the highest grade.
  The highest grade means more knowledge and that is why I'm aiming to 5. </p>
<p><em>4. What is your TIL for this course section?</em></p>
<p>I learnt in this section of the course many useful and intresting things
   such as creating functions, loops, variables in JavaScript; adding
   JavaScript file to HTML webpages, calling JavaScript functions from
  HTML webpages by using onclick method, creating classes and ids in HTML
  webpages and using them in CSS file, adding style to elements and changing
  them from JavaScript, and styling HTML webpages using CSS and making it
  more dynamically using JavaScript.</p>

<h2>S04</h2>
<p><em>1. Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal
   programming tools.</em></p>
<p>I have no experience on Node/npm. I attended lecture 4 which was
   about JavaScript, NodeJs and Express. I listened to the teacher and I
   learnt the basic of NodeJs and Express and its usages</p>
<p><em>2. How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node
  and Express?</em></p>
<p>It's really interesting to learn JavaScript, NodeJs and Express to combine
them together in order to make webpages dynamiclly and more organized</p>
<p><em>3. Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have
  a plan and did it work?</em></p>
<p>First, I learnt the code from the teacher during the lecture and the lab.
  Then, I watched some tutorials on Youtube in order to expand my knowledge
  and improve myself. My plan was to follow the teacher instructions and his
  code, then, to apply my knowledge that I got it from tutorials. My plan
  worked perfectly because of the knowledge that I grasped from the teacher
  and tutorials</p>
  <p><em>4. What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</em></p>
  <p>I'm aiming to grade<em>5</em>. Because, I did all the required
    assignments and I organized my code. However, it was a little bit
    hard to do all the assignments becuase all assignments require a
    good knowledge in NodeJs, JavaScript and Express.</p>
  <p><em>What is your TIL for this course section?</em></p>
  <p>I learnt about NodeJs, Express and JavaScript and how to combine them
    together. I learnt how to create local servers using Express, creating
    middlewares and its usages and advantages, create routing and its
    usages. In addition, I learnt how to create ejs webpages that have HTML
    code and javascript code, to work with requests and responses using
    Express, and to send Json files using Express.</p>

<h2>S05</h2>
<p><em>1. How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</em></p>
<p>It's a pwerful, widely-used, open source, general-purpose and scripting
  language that is used for web development and to make HTML webpages more
  dynamiclly. I like PHP because I can combine it with HTML and I can
  meake the webpages more organized and stylish</p>
  <p><em>2. Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</em></p>
  <p>PHP is implemented by C and C++. It looks like JavaScript as well.
     Because both of them are used for web development specifically for backend.
     Python also comes close to PHP on usage - and in fact, Python can be used
     as a substitute for PHP in many cases.</p>
  <p><em>3. Describe how you took on the coding exercise,
     what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</em></p>
  <p>Firstly, I learned from the teacher about PHP during the lecture. Then,
     I attended the lab where I saw the teacher writing a PHP code and
     listened to his comments. Secondly, I watched tutorials on Youtube to
     increase my knowledge and enhance my performance. I am aiming to get
     <em>5</em>. Because I did all the requirements of grade 5 and I
     followed the teacher instructions written on canvas.</p>
  <p><em>4. What is your TIL for this course section?</em></p>
  <p>I learned to create PHP files, combine PHP and HTML in one file, connect
     to database through PHP, run Apache server and apply CRUD on database
     inside PHP files. In addition, I learnt about forms in HTML and how to
     use them properly</p>

<h2>S06</h2>
<p><em>1. What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages
   and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming
    languages?</em></p>
    <p>According to GitHub's annual report for 2019, the most four popular
      programming languages among the developers are; PHP, Java, Python, and
      in first place is JavaScript. JavaScript remains the most popular
      programming language in the world becuase it's one of the main languages
      used for building web pages. It helps make websites interactive and
      can also be used for building games. JavaScript is lightweight,
      flexible, and powerful</p>
<p><em>2. What will be your own choice for selecting future
  programming languages?</em></p>
  <p>I will choose Python as a future programming language. Because, it's
     easy to learn and code. It's used for data analysis and
     machine learning and it has frameworks to create webpages (Django) and
     graphical user interface programs (GUI) which is (Tkinter).</p>
<p><em>3.Comparison on programming languages</em></p>
<p>I did a comparison on Google trends website between Python, JavaScript
   and Java, between 2015 and 2020. The results of search interest show
   that Java was so popular in 2015 comparing to Python and JavaScript.
   Between 19-25 April 2015, Java was at peak with 100% for searching, while
   JavaScript was 38% and Python 21%. Between 24-30 September 2017, the
   percentage between JavaScript and Python is the same (39% for each),
   while Java remains on top with 57%. In February 2018, Python had
   more percentage than JavaScript 41% and 40% respectively. However, in
   May 2019, Python had more percentage than JavaScript and Java.
   This shows that Python becomes more and more popular in time.</p>

   <span style="color:red">JavaScript/ </span>
   <span style="color:blue;">Python</span>
 </p>
 <p><em>4. If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your
    potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and
     how would you “sell it”?</em></p>
  <p>I would recommend Python because it's fast, flexible and powerful
    programming language. It has many frameworks to use in different areas
    such as Web, GUI and Data Analysis. I would show the result
    of comparison of Google trends between Python, Java and JavaScript.
    They can see how the popularity is increasing each year.</p>
    <p><em>5. What is your TIL for this course section?</em></p>
    <p>I learned many names of programming languages frameworks, such as
      Angular and React (JavaScript frameworks), and Tkinter and Django
    (Python frameworks). I learned also that is quite hard to learn all
    frameworks and programming languages. Instead, we should focus on one area
    and learn the programming language and its frameworks in order to become
    expert. As an example, I want to learn machine learning and data analysis,
    so I should focus more on Python and its libraries regarding to
    machine learning and data analysis such as Pandas, Numpy and scikit-learn</p>

<h2>S07</h2>
<p><em>1. Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled
  programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.</em></p>
  <p>It's a framework for building web applications and services by using
    .NET and C#. The base platform provides components that apply to all
    different types of apps. Additional frameworks, such as ASP.NET,
    extend .NET with components for building specific types of applications.</p>
    <p>It includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>. Base framework for processing web requests in C# or F#</li>
      <li>. Web-page templating syntax, known as Razor, for building
        dynamic web pages using C#</li>
      <li>. Libraries for common web patterns, such as Model View
        Controller (MVC)</li>
      <li>. Authentication system that includes libraries, a database,
        and template pages for handling logins, including multi-factor
        authentication and external authentication with Google, Twitter.</li>

<h2>S09</h2>
<p><em>1. Elaborate on a few (3-5) different security issues or concerns, 
from your own experience, related to web application security and relate 
them to the OWASP top ten.</em></p>
<ul>
<li> <span style="color: blue;">Injections Attacks:</span>
<p>In my first year, I started working on the connection between MYSQL database and applications. 
Since then, I have been paying attention to SQL injections. Where the attacker can send SQL command through 
an input to either get results from the databse or to change values in the databse. 
Using PreparedStatement in Java helped me to prevent SQL injection, because the query and the 
data are sent to the database separately.</p>
</li>

<li> <span style="color: blue;"> Insecure Deserialization:</span>
<p> Insecure Deserialization is a vulnerability which occurs when untrusted data is used to 
abuse the logic of an application. Deserialization is transforming serialized data coming from a 
file, stream or network socket into an object. However, Successful insecure deserialization attacks 
could allow an attacker to carry out denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, authentication bypasses 
and remote code execution attacks. To prevent this attack, we should use JSON format instead 
of binary native format, include positive validation based on signatures for serialized data,
 avoid protection based on pattern matching such as WAF and DAST, and Prevent remote execution.</p>
</li>

<li> <span style="color: blue;"> Broken Access Control:</span>
<p> Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced. 
Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or data, 
such as access other users’ accounts. To prevent this attack, we should Implement access control 
mechanisms once and re-use them throughout the application, including minimizing CORS usage, 
enforce record ownership, rather than accepting that the user can create, read, update, or delete any record, 
 ensure file metadata and backup files are not present within web roots.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>2. Summarize by providing your own guidelines to a new web programmer on the topic 
“The essential guidelines to follow to create secure web applications”.</em></p>
<p> In order to build low-risk web-based applications, these steps should be taken in concerns:</p>
<p>1. Query parameterisation: A web form comments box, data field or another area of a form that 
allows free data entry, especially open string input, can lead to this vulnerability. To stop SQL injection, 
we must prevent untrusted input from being interpreted as part of a SQL command by using for instance 
prepared statement in Java</p>
<br>
<p>2. Secure password storage: The worst method for storing passwords is in plain text; 
however, encryption isn’t much better because it’s reversible. To store passwords correctly, we should 
 use a one-way algorithm such as SCRYPT and PBKDF2 , use a salt, and use an algorithm that is purposely slow, 
 in order to prevent GPU cracking rigs</p>
 <br>
 <p>3.  Multi factor authentication: Using multi factor authentication helps us to protect our password 
 and log-in credential. In order to show the correct person is loggin-in multi factor authentication 
 is a great tool and servers this purpose. </p>
 <br>
 <p>4. Cross site request forgery: Once a user has logged into a secure site, if they were then to open 
 another tab and inadvertently launch a malicious site, the site in question could host a forged 
 request that could take advantage of the fact that the user is already logged in. To prevent this, we should
  ask  users to re-authenticate to complete a transaction or event to prevent in-session hijacks.</p>
<p><em>3. What is your TIL for this course section?</em></p>
<p>I learnt today about the Open Web Application Security Project(OWASP) which is an online community
 that gives useful information about web vulnerabilities and risks, and gives articles and tips 
 in order to minimize or prevent these risks. I learnt about the most common risks in the web and 
 how hackers can take advantage of these risks to attack and steal information and harm the websites and applications.</p>
