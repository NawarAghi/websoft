<h2>S01</h2>
<p><em>1- Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown
  and/or GitHub Pages?</em></p>
<p>I know about Git and GitHub because in the first year we did a project
   and we connected it to GitHub. In the second year,I worked with GitHub
    desktop application because I found it more easier than using Git bash.
    However, I have never worked with GitHub pages before.</p>
<p><em>2- Have you ever created websites before?</em></p>
<p>I have never created websites before. However, I have worked a little
  bit with HTML and CSS before. So, I am familiar with some basics of
  HTML and CSS.</p>
<p><em>3- Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web
  application development.</em></p>
  <p>I have worked with HTML and CSS but a little bit. However,
     I studied Network Applications course which I learnt to work
     with backend and create servers and clients using Java.</p>
     <p><em>4- What is your TIL for this course section?</em></p>
     <p>In the first assignment, I learnt to use GitHub pages and to fork.
       In addition, I became more familiar with Git bash and create tags
       using git bash.</p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p><em>1. Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?
</em></p>
<p>I have some experience of HTML and CSS. However, I don't have any
experience of JavaScript</p>
<p><em>2. Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in
   web development.</em></p>
<p>HTML is used to create basic and simple webpages, CSS is used to style
and decorate the HTML webpages and to make HTML webpage look better and
nicer, and JavaScript is used to make webpages dynamic. It gives the user
the ability to interact with webpages dynamiclly. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
 work together as a frontend.</p>
 <p><em>3. Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol
   and the web server interacts.</em></p>
   <p>The browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real
     address of the server that the website lives on. The browser sends an HTTP
     request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to
     the client. This message, and all other data sent between the client
      and the server, is sent across internet using TCP/IP.</p>
